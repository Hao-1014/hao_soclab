# Multiplier

## Design
The given code will be synthesized to a 32-bits multiplier. And a testbench is to simulate a 9*9  multiplication table.
The goal of this lab is to install the required application such as vivado and vitis_hls given by Xilinx and get familiar with their manipulation. The other objective is to learn how to use remote FPGA board in this lab.
